                 This policy describes the ways Cryptopayz and its subsidiaries (hereinafter, “Cryptopayz”, “we”, “our” or “us”) collect, store, use and protect personal information. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that Cryptopayz complies with applicable United States (US) federal and state regulations, and European Union (EU) data protection laws, and ensures that users are provided privacy protection. Cryptopayz ’s Services include merchant processing services, products, or any other features, technologies or functionalities (hereinafter: “Services”) offered by Cryptopayz. There are three types of users whose personal<br>information we may process:
                  <div class="list_of">
                     <p> <span>1.</span>Visitors of our website;</p>
                    <p><span>2.</span> Merchants that sign up for our Services;</p>
                    <p><span>3.</span> Shoppers who indirectly interface with Cryptopayz when paying a merchant’s invoice that is forwarded by<br> Cryptopayz to merchants during checkout (refer to Section III.3 for more details). </p>
                  </div>
                  Users accept this Policy by visiting our website and/or by using our Services.

            <h3 class="zdes1">What is “personally identifiable information?”</h3>
            <p class="ottext">“Personally identifiable information” (hereinafter: “personal information”) is any information that can be directly associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. A prime example of identifiable information is a person’s name.</p>
            <h3 class="linerrdesc">What kind of information do we collect?</h3>
            <div class="textstyleall">
              The information we collect depends on the type of user:<br>
1. Visitors: we may collect standard web log information, such as:<br>
          <span class="vec1">IP address</span>
          <span class="vec1">Browser type</span>
          <span class="vec1">Pages accessed on our website</span>
          <span class="vec1">Date and time the website was accessed</span>
2. We may collect information about a visitor’s computer or other access devices for fraud prevention purposes.<br>
3. Merchants: when opening an account, we may collect the following types of personal information, depending on how you use our Services:<br>
          <span class="vec1">Name</span>
          <span class="vec1">Address</span>
          <span class="vec1">Phone</span>
          <span class="vec1">E-mail address</span>
          <span class="vec1">Bank account number</span>
          <span class="vec1">VAT/EIN-number</span>
          <span class="vec1">Identification documents (which could contain photo, social security number and/or date of birth).</span>
4. We may use this information for risk-management purposes (i.e. to verify merchant’s identity or address). We may also obtain information about our merchants  
    from third parties such as credit bureaus and identity verification services. We ensure that such third parties adhere to the same data protection principles as 
    Cryptopayz.
5. Shoppers of merchants: when a Shopper wants to pay an invoice created by a Cryptopayz merchant, the Shopper will be requested to fill in the following:<br>
          <span class="vec1">Email address</span>
6. This information is requested since it will enable our system to send an email to Shoppers directly to obtain a bitcoin refund address in case of a payment 
    exception (e.g. overpayments, underpayments, etc.). This creates a more seamless payment experience for both our Merchants and their Shoppers.<br>
7. Additionally, only upon the merchant’s explicit request, we will collect and store personal information for the merchant’s benefit only and as a service through our  
    invoicing service. Information that merchants may request from the shoppers may include:
          <span class="vec1">Name</span>
          <span class="vec1">Address</span>
          <span class="vec1">Phone</span>
          <span class="vec1">Email address</span>
8. In both cases mentioned above, Shoppers’ information is processed and stored according to the same principles we store our merchant’s personal information.
Cryptopayz does not process any sensitive personal information, such as religion, race, ethnicity and/or political views.

<h3 class="linerrdesc">How we use cookies</h3>
<div class="textthe">
  
  <h4 class="jhtr">What are cookies?</h4>
  <p class="thhtext">A cookie is a small piece of data that a website asks your browser to store on your computer or mobile device. The cookie allows the website to “remember” your actions or preferences over time. Most browsers support cookies, but you can set your browser to decline them and delete them whenever you like.</p>


  <h4 class="jhtr">What type of cookies do we use?</h4>
  <p class="thhtext">When you access our website, we, or companies we hire to track how our website is used, may place small data files called “cookies” on your computer. We and our service providers also use cookies to customize the Cryptopayz Services, content, and advertising; measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety.</p>
  <p class="thhtext">We send a “session cookie” to your computer when you log in to your account or otherwise use the Cryptopayz Services.

  <p class="thhtext">We encode our cookies so that only we can interpret the information stored in them. You are free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may interfere with your use of our website. We may also collect information about your computer or other access device to mitigate risk and for fraud prevention purposes.</p>
  <p class="thhtext">You may encounter cookies from third parties when using the Cryptopayz Services on websites that we do not control (for example, if you view a web page created by a third party or use an application developed by a third party, there may be a cookie placed by that web page or application.)</p>
  <h4 class="jhtr">Managing your cookie settings</h4>
<p class="thhtext">You can manage cookies through the settings of your Internet browser.
